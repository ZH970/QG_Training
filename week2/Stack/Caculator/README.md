# **Week2: Calculator by linked Stack**

- **TOOLCHAIN: Visual Studio2022 + C + Typora + Git**

  

- File: 

  -Caculator: Project File

    |-exe

    |-代码和头文件 : *Codes*

  ​      |- head

  ​      |- source

  

- Calculator can only calculate 1bit number now. So eg:

  `input:`

  `15+2`

  `Result:7`

- At the end of the calculation, you can use # or '\n' to as a symbol of end, which is actually the same.

  

- I find that it cann't modify the stacknode point int the function. So I use an ugly way... You can see them in the code. Also give me a suggestion or PR a new way, which is really help me a lot ^ _ ^
